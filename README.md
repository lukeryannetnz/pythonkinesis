# pythonkinesis
Experimenting with AWS Kinesis using python.

* Uses the boto library http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/kinesis.html
* Most of the code heavily inspired by this boto test https://github.com/boto/boto/blob/develop/tests/integration/kinesis/test_kinesis.py#L33
* The kinesis API docs are useful too http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html
* To use this code you need to tell boto your AWS credentials as per http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
